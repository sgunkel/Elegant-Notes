## Elegant Notes
Elegant Notes is personal knowledge management system based on [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) for your homelab/self-hosted setup.

Elegant Notes embraces the Block-base approach via an outline format. Powerful backlink traversal can be used via Page Links, Tags, and Block References, which can make your notes have relationships with each other. This makes a more natural way of taking notes found in similar tools, with built-in version control and a better task management system.

## Notice
This is still a work in progress. See the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) of the project with planned features for V1.0. Current state of everything:

This shows the actual application on the left with traffic on the right. Note that this is not the production UI but rather a development system.

### WIP Status
- This system is under heavy development and will have different aspects change quickly
- The system is based on [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) to be a clone that can run on homelabs, including low-powered devices such as a Raspberry Pi
- Check out the [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for the [version 1.0](./roadmap.md#version-10) features
