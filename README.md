## Elegant Notes
Experimental throwaway branch that may or may not live for a while as a reference if we choose to use this framework.
- [Installation + simple example](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation)
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) for default route configurations to the root/index response
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/) for system route documentation (with default configurations)
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) for a slightly nicer version of above

### Notes
- The [Automatic Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#automatic-docs) is really nice
- If the frontend is a client-side rendering application (still up for debate), this would be perfect
- [Might be able to use HTML responses and have redirects](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/responses/)
- [Can use Jinja templates](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/templating/)
- [Seems to have support for uploading files](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/uploadfile/) (useful for users uploading multimedia files)
